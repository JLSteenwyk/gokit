About
=====

^^^^^

**GO** enrichment analysis tool\ **KIT** (**gokit**) was developed as
part of `Jacob L. Steenwyk <https://jlsteenwyk.github.io/>`_'s
software portfolio for computational biology.

gokit is a command-line toolkit for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis.
It provides overrepresentation analysis (ORA) using Fisher's exact test
and supports semantic similarity comparisons for GO terms across
single or batch study scenarios.

gokit is designed with zero core dependencies for maximum portability,
and supports multiple association file formats including id2gos, GAF,
GPAD, and NCBI gene2go with automatic format detection.
